# LowkeyPrepped üöÄ

LowkeyPrepped redefines interview preparation with an AI-powered mock interview platform designed specifically for software engineers. It‚Äôs not just another practice tool; it‚Äôs a personalized coaching experience that delivers realistic mock interviews covering both technical and behavioral aspects.

Our conversational AI simulates real-world interview scenarios, providing:
- üí¨ Instant feedback on responses
- üéØ Highlighting areas for improvement
- ü§ñ Guidance when a user gets stuck

Technical interviews are challenging, but LowkeyPrepped breaks them down, helping users tackle everything from coding questions to system design.

1. **Create a `.env.local` file** at the root of your project. You will need to add your API keys here.
   - Follow just the first two steps to get the API keys in this [tutorial](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)
   - Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk) to obtain your own Convex API keys.
   - Additionally, get your **Google Text-to-Speech API key** by following [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/before-you-begin).

2. Your `.env.local` file should look something like this:
    ```
    # Deployment used by `npx convex dev`
    CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=YOUR_KEY
    
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=YOUR_KEY
    
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    
    CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=YOUR_KEY
        
    NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_URL=YOUR_KEY
    
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    ```

3. Install the necessary packages by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. To start development, run the following commands:
  - Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
