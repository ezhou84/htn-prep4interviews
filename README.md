LowkeyPrepped redefines interview preparation with an AI-powered mock interview platform designed specifically for software engineers. It’s not just another practice tool; it’s a personalized coaching experience that delivers realistic mock interviews covering both technical and behavioral aspects!

Our conversational AI simulates real-world interview scenarios, providing:
